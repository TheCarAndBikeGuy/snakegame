# Welcome To The Snake Game 
## Created using Next.js, React & deployed on Vercel. 

Vercel - https://snakegame-vert-two.vercel.app/

Figma - https://www.figma.com/board/kjwvPEgGNX4gV5jDYM3nr5/Snake?t=BVitoCfrHgqw1J09-0

### Day One - 
- Have been working on setting up the project, such as setting up the next.js, adding to the README, and cloning to my local. 
- I also made a favicon that can be viewed in Vercel or Figma.
- Looked into inspiration and ideas for setting up my app.

### Day Two - 
- I have been adding a wireframe, user stories, MVP, and layout to Figma to show how I want it to work.
- I also created a logo.
- I set up the clerk authentication.

### Day Three -
- Today I sorted the CSS and added in the logo. However I may change my mind about the logo later on. 
- Also added CSS on the Sign In button and added a accordion to the about page.
